## Why

In the modern age, we own so little. We rent media and invest our creativity into ephemeral platforms. This is not a rant against social media or the enshitification of subscription culture, but rather my attempt at preserving a small piece of the internet with a few clear stipulations:

### Dumb formats

All writings here will be done in Markdown and then parsed into pages.

It is ok to utilize a wrapper that may or may not stand the test of time (I am using SvelteKit on CloudFlare), but the source material must be readable as plain text.

Additional media will be in the most common format possible (mp3, jpg, png, gif) unless the format itself is part of the work.

### Solitude

The world is noisy, and it's hard to have any thoughts without the influence of others. If at all possible, I want this to be a place without external validation metrics. If I want feedback, I must ask for it instead of casually checking for likes or comments.

### Corporate freedom

I don't want my work to disappear because of decisions in a boardroom. I don't want my work to make a platform more profitable. The internet used to be a place of sharing and not profiting and I'm old enough to feel the loss of that.
