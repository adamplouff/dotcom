# Why?

The current [adamplouff.com](https://adamplouff.com) is built on an Adobe product (Behance and proSite) that features an outdated list of design projects. It does not reflect me and endorses a company whose financial practices I disapprove of.

I want to create a:
- more updatable site
- listing what I am currently working on
- away from any corporations
\
- [l] adamplouff.com is simple and we do not need any more abstractions. Just because you bought a domain doesn't mean you need to use it.

### Friction

There is a strange dichotomy between friction and seamlessness. On the one hand, I want to be able to easily share something, and on the other, I need limits to force intention.

# Hosting

Namecheap: 2 years - $37.88 + 14 for SSL

Potentially just doing on github pages
	Maybe have a `src` and `dist` folder and serve from `dist`
